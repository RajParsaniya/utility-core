<h3>(18) Stream.forEach()</h3>

<p>
	The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank">Stream</a> interface provides a
	<strong>forEach()</strong> method that accepts a
	<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Consumer.html" target="_blank">Consumer</a> functional interface,
	which performs an action for each element of the stream, and is typically used for side effects.

					The <strong>setCatchable()</strong> method allows you to specify which exceptions should be caught and handled internally, ensuring that the

					The following code demonstrates how to apply the <strong>forEach()</strong> method to a list of file paths, ensuring that the stream
					continues processing even in the presence of checked exception. For each file path, it reads the content of the file and prints it to the
					console. Note that the order of processing is not guaranteed for parallel streams.

					The following code demonstrates how to apply the <strong>forEach()</strong> method to a stream of items, ensuring that the stream continues

					and the <strong>forEach()</strong> operation performs the desired side effect for each item in the stream. In this case, it prints each
					person's details along with their index.
