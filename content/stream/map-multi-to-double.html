<h3>(13) Stream.mapMultiToDouble()</h3>

<p>
	The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank">Stream</a> interface provides a
	<strong>mapMultiToDouble()</strong> method that accepts a
	<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/BiConsumer.html" target="_blank">BiConsumer</a> functional
	interface, which allows mapping each element to multiple double values using a provided consumer, and returns a
	<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/DoubleStream.html" target="_blank">DoubleStream</a>
	consisting of the produced double elements.

					The following code demonstrates how to apply the <strong>mapMultiToDouble()</strong> method to a list of file paths, ensuring that the
					stream continues processing even in the presence of checked exception. For each file path, it generates the file size in bytes, KB, MB, and
					GB as double values and emits them to the resulting
					<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/DoubleStream.html" target="_blank">DoubleStream</a>.
					The final result is a list containing these file sizes for all file paths.
