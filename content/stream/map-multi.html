<h3>(10) Stream.mapMulti()</h3>

<p>
	The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank">Stream</a> interface provides a
	<strong>mapMulti()</strong> method that accepts a
	<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/BiConsumer.html" target="_blank">BiConsumer</a>
	functional interface, which allows mapping each element to multiple results using a provided consumer, and returns a new stream consisting of the produced
	elements.

					The <strong>setCatchable()</strong> method allows you to specify which exceptions should be caught and handled internally, ensuring that the
					stream flow remains uninterrupted. Additionally, the <strong>setThrowable()</strong> method lets you define which exceptions should be
					rethrown—optionally wrapping them with custom messages or exception types for more controlled error propagation.

					The following code demonstrates how to apply the <strong>mapMulti()</strong> method to a list of file paths, ensuring that the stream
					continues processing even in the presence of checked exception. For each file path, it generates two strings—one containing the file content
					and another containing the file size, and emits them to the resulting stream. The final result is a list containing these generated strings
					for all file paths.

					The following code demonstrates how to apply the <strong>mapMulti()</strong> method to a list of names while ensuring that the stream

					element, such as combining the name with its corresponding country and age. These generated values are then emitted to the resulting stream,
					resulting in a list of formatted details for each name.
