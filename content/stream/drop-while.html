<h3>(17) Stream.dropWhile()</h3>

<p>
	The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank">Stream</a> interface provides a
	<strong>dropWhile()</strong> method that accepts a
	<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Predicate.html" target="_blank">Predicate</a>
	functional interface, which represents a boolean-valued function, and returns a new stream consisting of the remaining elements after discarding the longest
	prefix of elements that satisfy the specified condition.

					The <strong>setCatchable()</strong> method allows you to specify which exceptions should be caught and handled internally, ensuring that the

					The following code demonstrates how to apply the <strong>dropWhile()</strong> method to a list of file paths, ensuring that the stream
					continues processing even in the presence of checked exception. The provided predicate function checks if the file size exceeds a specified
					maximum size. The <strong>dropWhile()</strong> operation discards initial file paths from the stream as long as this condition is true. The
					resulting stream contains the remaining file paths.

					The following code demonstrates how to apply the <strong>dropWhile()</strong> method to a stream of items, ensuring that the stream

					it checks whether the age associated with each element qualifies . The resulting stream contains the remaining items after the condition
