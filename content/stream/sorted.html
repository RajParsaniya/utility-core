<h3>(14) Stream.sorted()</h3>

<p>
	The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html" target="_blank">Stream</a> interface provides a
	<strong>sorted()</strong> method that returns a new stream consisting of the elements of the original stream sorted in natural order or by a provided
	comparator.

					The <strong>setCatchable()</strong> method allows you to specify which exceptions should be caught and handled internally, ensuring that the

					The following code demonstrates how to apply the <strong>sorted()</strong> method to a list of file paths, ensuring that the stream
					continues processing even in the presence of checked exception. It sorts the file paths based on their file sizes using a
					<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Comparator.html" target="_blank">Comparator</a>. After
					sorting, it reads the content of each file and joins them into a single string.
